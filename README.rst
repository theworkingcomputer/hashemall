Hash 'em all
############

A simple little python data structure utility to help me make sure I understand how different data structures can be implemented in general, and how to implement them in python, by writng a utility that implements the structure in question as a dict, simply by importing hashemall.py and invoking the structure, e.g.: import hashemall ... list = new linked_list().

We'll see how it goes. Idea is inspired by the cute little article by Elben Shira entitled `The Universal Data Structure <http://elbenshira.com/blog/the-universal-data-structure/>`_.  ;-)
